# WalkerItemDB
RESTFul API that Pulls Product information from UPCItemDB.com 

This API was written Specifically for Texas Wholesale Computers to automatically pull product information for incoming truckloads of Overstock. Items are scanned, and all relevant product information is shown to the end-user on a command line. Only Product from Home Depot, Target, or Lowe's will be shown, as that is where the products are coming from on the trucks.
